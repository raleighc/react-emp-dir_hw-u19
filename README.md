[Deployed Employee Directory App!](https://raleighc.github.io/react-emp-dir_hw-u19/)

## Description

This application lets the user view all employees in a directory with the ability to search by name and sort in order alphabetically.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Usage

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
